# Digital Clock using React

A simple digital clock built with React that displays the current time in a 12-hour format with AM/PM.

The clock updates every second using React Hooks and JavaScript’s Date object.

The UI features a full-screen background image, centered layout, and a subtle blur effect for a clean and modern look.
